RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and itâ€™s is a simple, standardized content distribution method that can help you stay up-to-date with your favorite newscasts, blogs, websites, and social media channels. 
Instead of visiting sites to find new posts or subscribing to sites to receive notification of new posts, [find the RSS feed on a website and read new posts](https://www.lifewire.com/find-an-rss-feed-on-a-website-3486647) in an RSS reader.

```
from RSSFinder.RSS_Finder import RSS_Finder
RSSFinder().Find_Feeds('https://www.farsnews.ir')
